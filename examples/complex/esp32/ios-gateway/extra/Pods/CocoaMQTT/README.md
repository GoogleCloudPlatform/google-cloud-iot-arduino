MQTT v3.1.1 client library for iOS/macOS/tvOS  written with Swift 5


## Build

Build with Xcode 10.2 / Swift 5


## Installation
### CocoaPods

Install using [CocoaPods](http://cocoapods.org) by adding this line to your Podfile:

```ruby
use_frameworks! # Add this if you are targeting iOS 8+ or using Swift
pod 'CocoaMQTT'  
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage
Install using [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) by adding the following lines to your Cartfile:

```
github "emqtt/CocoaMQTT" "master"
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ carthage update --platform iOS,macOS,tvOS
```

Last if you're building for OS X:

- On your application targets “General” settings tab, in the "Embedded Binaries" section, drag and drop CocoaMQTT.framework from the Carthage/Build/Mac folder on disk.

If you're building for iOS, tvOS:

- On your application targets “General” settings tab, in the "Linked Frameworks and Libraries" section, drag and drop each framework you want to use from the Carthage/Build folder on disk.

- On your application targets "Build Phases" settings tab, click the "+" icon and choose "New Run Script Phase". Create a Run Script with the following contents: 

    ```
    /usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks
    ```

- and add the paths to the frameworks you want to use under "Input Files", e.g.:

    ```
    $(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/CocoaMQTT.framework
    ```

## Usage

Create a client to connect MQTT Broker:

```swift
let clientID = "CocoaMQTT-" + String(NSProcessInfo().processIdentifier)
let mqtt = CocoaMQTT(clientID: clientID, host: "localhost", port: 1883)
mqtt.username = "test"
mqtt.password = "public"
mqtt.willMessage = CocoaMQTTWill(topic: "/will", message: "dieout")
mqtt.keepAlive = 60
mqtt.delegate = self
mqtt.connect()
```

Now you can use closures instead of `CocoaMQTTDelegate`:

```swift 
mqtt.didReceiveMessage = { mqtt, message, id in
	print("Message received in topic \(message.topic) with payload \(message.string!)")           
}
```

## SSL Secure

#### One-way certification

No certificate is required locally.
If you want to trust all untrust CA certificates, you can do this:

```swift
mqtt.allowUntrustCACertificate = true
```

#### Two-way certification

Need a .p12 file which is generated by a public key file and a private key file. You can generate the p12 file in the terminal:

```
openssl pkcs12 -export -clcerts -in client-cert.pem -inkey client-key.pem -out client.p12
```

## Example App

You can follow the Example App to learn how to use it. But we need to make the Example App works fisrt:

```bash
$ cd Examples

$ pod install
```

Then, open the `Example.xcworkspace/` by Xcode and start it!
